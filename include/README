# Header files

This folder contains the public headers for the firmware. The most
relevant files for day-to-day configuration are:

- `Config.h` – compile-time constants such as Wi-Fi credentials,
  backend host and RFID reader wiring. New constants include the
  `RfidHardwareType` enum, the `NFC_READER_TYPE` selector and the
  default pin assignments for both MFRC522 (SPI) and PN532 (I²C)
  breakouts. Adjust these values to match your hardware.
- `RfidReader.h` – façade for the RFID hardware. The reader now
  instantiates the proper backend automatically based on
  `NFC_READER_TYPE`, so application code only needs to call
  `RfidReader::begin()` and `RfidReader::readCard()`.

To switch between RC522 and PN532 hardware, edit `Config.h` and set:

```cpp
static constexpr RfidHardwareType NFC_READER_TYPE = RfidHardwareType::PN532;
```

Then update the relevant pin constants (`NFC_SS_PIN`/`NFC_RST_PIN` for the
RC522 or `PN532_IRQ_PIN`, `PN532_RST_PIN`, `PN532_SDA_PIN`, `PN532_SCL_PIN`
for the PN532). Rebuild and upload the firmware – the rest of the code
path is hardware-agnostic.
