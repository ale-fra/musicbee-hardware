# AGENTS.md spec
- Containers often contain AGENTS.md files. These files can appear anywhere in the container's filesystem. Typical locations include `/`, `~`, and in various places inside of Git repos.
- These files are a way for humans to give you (the agent) instructions or tips for working within the container.
- Some examples might be: coding conventions, info about how code is organized, or instructions for how to run or test code.
- AGENTS.md files may provide instructions about PR messages (messages attached to a GitHub Pull Request produced by the agent, describing the PR). These instructions should be respected.
- Instructions in AGENTS.md files:
    - The scope of an AGENTS.md file is the entire directory tree rooted at the folder that contains it.
    - For every file you touch in the final patch, you must obey instructions in any AGENTS.md file whose scope includes that file.
    - Instructions about code style, structure, naming, etc. apply only to code within the AGENTS.md file's scope, unless the file states otherwise.
    - More-deeply-nested AGENTS.md files take precedence in the case of conflicting instructions.
    - Direct system/developer/user instructions (as part of a prompt) take precedence over AGENTS.md instructions.
- AGENTS.md files need not live only in Git repos. For example, you may find one in your home directory.
